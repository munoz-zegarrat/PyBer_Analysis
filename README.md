# PyBer_Analysis
##Overview of the Analysis

This analysis was conducted to help PyBer, a ride-sharing service, understand some trends in regards to its services (per cost of ride, number of drivers, peak number of rides, etc. per area) to improve its service and increase accesibility to more users.

##Results
-The total fares in urban cities is approximately 9 times higher than in rural cities and 2 times higher than suburban cities. 
-There are approximately 13 times more rides in urban cities compare to rural cities.
-The average fare per ride is approximately 1.4 times less and the average fare per driver is 3.4 times less in urban cities compare to rural cities.
Detailed analysis of this can be found in the PyBer_Challenge.ipynb file and complementary line chart.


##Summary
Urban areas have significantly more rides than Suburban areas and rural areas as one would expect; And the most drivers are present in urban areas. In regard to average per ride, rural areas generate approximately USD 4 more per ride than suburban and rural make even more on average per ride than urban areas, which may be due to the long distance between areas of interest in more remote areas. 

PyBer's CEO should (1) provide greater incentives to increase the number of drivers in suburban and rural areas given the high profitability in regard to average fare per ride, (2) given the high demand for rides in urban areas, increase the number of drivers and lower fares to increase accessibility to others, (3) do further analysis of peak seasons and adjust prices accordingly to increase PyBer's profitability.
